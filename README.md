Product Vision  
FOR people of all ages with internet and mobile access  
WHO are in need of recreation and entertainment,   
THE sidekick is a mobile app that recognizes jokes told using natural language processing   
THAT provides recognition and feedback to the customer.   
UNLIKE  other boring chatbots,  
OUR product is actually entertaining to speak with.  


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#To get started, cd into the sidekick directory and run:   
npm install //note, you must already have node installed   
#this installs all the dependencies for your web-app   
 #a list of dependencies can be found in package.json inside project folder   

 #After that run:
 npm start
 #this starts a local server in your port which locally hosts your web-app
