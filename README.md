# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#To get started, cd into the sidekick directory and run:
npm install //note, you must already have node installed
#this installs all the dependencies for your web-app
#a list of dependencies can be found in package.json inside project folder

#After that run:
npm start
#this starts a local server in your port which locally hosts your web-app
